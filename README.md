# FROST-Project
FROST is a forearm-worn device for use while snowboarding. This device allows for the user to interact with technology without removing a glove or pulling out a phone.

## Possible Future Features
- **Clock** (DONE) - to easily check the time while on the slopes
- **Stopwatch** (DONE) - to track the amount of time a run (or a slow ski-lift) takes
- **Bluetooth** (DONE) - to control music from your wrist without taking your phone out
- **Temperature Probe** - swings out from the device to check the temperature of your precise location (rather than the regional temperature from the weather app)
- **GPS** - for accurate location tracking on the mountain
- **Activity Logging** - for tracking your time spent on the mountain
